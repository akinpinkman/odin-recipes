    <center><h2>How to Cook Salt Bae Boiling Butter Tenderloin </h2></center>
        <br>
    <ol>
        <li>For the buttery delight tenderloin,rub the whole fillet on the form of wick
            with a light massage with oil or olive oil, black pepper and thyme without
            cutting it.</li>
        <li>In this way, wrap it in stretch wrap with film, and let it rest for 2 hours at room
            tempature. You can marinate a day in advance in the refigerator.</li>
        <li>Take out casting pan to the stove and heat it well over high heat until smoke comes out.</li>
        <li>Take your tenderloin whole in the pan and seal each side for 1 minute.
            After the meat is covered with brown crust on each side, finish the sealing process and let it rest for 
            5 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you wish, continue in the same pan while it is hot, add the butter and melt.</li>
        <li>After all the butter has melted, you can add the tenderloin, which we cut into 8mm thick slices, while serving
            at the table in the presentation.</li>
        <li>No need to worry when the pan cools down at its own tempature, your meat will be cooked in approximately 30-40 seconds as
            it is pre-cooked. For well-cooked meat, you can leave your meat for a while.</li>
        <li>You can serve the tenderloin in this way.</li>
        <li>Bon appetit!</li>
    </ol>
